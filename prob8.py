Problem 8

Task:

Given a list of strings representing student names and a corresponding list of integers representing their scores, return a dictionary where:

Keys = student names

Values = their highest score

If a student appears more than once, keep only the maximum score.

Example:

names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Alice", "Charlie", "Bob"]
scores = [85, 90, 92, 70, 88]

Output: {'Alice': 92, 'Bob': 90, 'Charlie': 70}
